FEM Magnetics Toolbox (FEMMT)
=============================

Python toolbox to generate preconfigured figures for FEM simulation
tools in power electronics.

The toolbox contains two parts, a reluctance module and a FEM module. 

* The reluctance module is for pre-calculations 
* The FEM module is for detailed calculations

The toolbox is accessible via python code or a graphical user interface
(GUI), which current development status is experimental.

Functionality examples 

* work with pre-defined standard core structures
* work with pre-defined litz wires 
* use python to perform parametersweeps, e.g.Â perform several automated simulations of different air gap sizes 
* read the results automated with python from the FEM simulation tool
* run a thermal simulation to see the temperatures, once the magnetoquasistatic simulation has finished

**Note: Alpha Version!** 

* GUI is experimental, 
* reluctance module is currently working for a single optimization example and not fully implemented yet.

Detailed Documentation
-------------------------

Can be found
`here <https://upb-lea.github.io/FEM_Magnetics_Toolbox/main/intro.html>`__.

Installation
---------------

ONELAB installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Go to https://onelab.info/
-  Download the Desktop Version for your OS (Windows, Linux or macOS)
-  Unpack the software and remember the file path. This will be needed
   later when installing FEMMT.

Install FEMMT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chose to install the development version of FEMMT or the release
version.

FEMMT release version (recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the stable release version.

::

   pip install femmt

FEMMT development version (for developers only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the latest development version with the latest features. Note:
You may need to install `git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`__.
Also have a look at the . `developers notes </developers_notes.md>`__.


::

   cd /Documents/Folder/of/Interest   
   git clone git@github.com:upb-lea/FEM_Magnetics_Toolbox.git
   pip install -e .

Minimal example and first run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the example from here:
`basic_example.py </femmt/examples/basic_example.py>`__. FEMMT will ask
you for the installation path of ONELAB during first use.

Examples
-----------

This toolbox is able to build a complete FEM simulation from simple
Python code. The following figure shows the Python code on the left and
the corresponding FEM simulation on the right. |image1|

Basics
~~~~~~~~~~

Code examples can be found in this `example
file </femmt/examples/basic_example.py>`__. This file is updated
regulary.

The magnetic component can be an inductor, a transformer, or a
transformer with integrated stray path. The parameterization process is
divided into the following steps: 

1. Chose simulation type, 
2. set core parameters (geometry, material), 
3. set air gap parameters (position, height), 
4. set conductor parameters (litz/solid wire), 
5. start simulation with given frequencies and currents and phases.

Find an example here, and check out the `example
file </femmt/examples/basic_example.py>`__ for more examples!

The examples contain among other things: 

* Geometries: Coil, transformer, transformer with integrated stray path, 
* wire and stranded wire definition, 
* air gaps definition, 
* excitation with different frequencies, amplitudes and phases.

The simulation results can be found in the file
/python-side-packages-path/femmt/femmt/results/result_log_electro_magnetic.json.
In it you can find 

* power loss in the core: hysteresis losses and eddy current losses, 
* losses per winding and for each individual winding,
* self- and mutual inductances.

For more information about the possible winding types, please
have a look `here <winding_overview.md>`__.

GUI (Experimental)
-------------------

There is a first preview for a GUI. Installing this is a bit cumbersome
at first, but will be simplified in the future: 

* Download the complete repository via ``Code`` -> ``Download ZIP`` and unpack it. 
* install the development version of femmt as described above 
* run python ``downloads/path-to_femmt/femmt/gui/femmt_gui.py``

Please note, the GUI is experimental.

Roadmap
----------

Planned features in 2022: 

* Software stability and general improvements, 
* add more Functionality to the GUI,

History and project status
------------------------------

This project was initially written in matlab using FEMM simulation tool.
It became clear that the project was no longer a small project. The
project should be completely rewritten, because many new complex levels
have been added. To place the project in the open source world, the
programming language python is used.
