# FEMM installation [for Windows User only]
For verification, FEMMT can also control FEMM. The functionality is limited, e.g. the air gaps are limeted to the 'center'-type. Other types, like 'percent' are not implemented. To install FEMM, follow the next steps:
 * Go to https://www.femm.info/wiki/Download
 * Install FEMM as described
 * FEMM can be used as an alternative FEM solver for 2D simulations

This is only supported on Windows-OS. To use it, there are functions like 'femm_reference'.
